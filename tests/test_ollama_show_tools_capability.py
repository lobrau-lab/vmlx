"""`/api/show` must not advertise "tools" for a model with no tool parser.

endpoint appended "tools" unconditionally, justified in-source as a "permissive
default — most models support tools", directly beneath a line that fetched
`globals().get("_tool_parser")` and never read the result.

That name has never existed anywhere in server.py — the real global is
`_tool_call_parser`. So the lookup was always None and the gate it was clearly
meant to feed never ran. Worth stating plainly, because the obvious "fix" of
wiring `if _tp is not None` would have removed "tools" from EVERY model and
endpoint worked at all.

Advertising tools without a parser is not harmless: the client sends tool
schemas, the model emits its native tool markup, nothing extracts it, and the
raw markup is delivered to the user as the visible answer.
